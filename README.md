# Repository info
*GitHub repository of my current SOÄŒ/KOP 2019 project - lincensed under the MIT license*

This repository was established for tracking changes and managing my workflow

For the current development progress see the [devel branch](https://github.com/KLZ-0/Alames/tree/devel)

I merge to master only if the software is in stable (or partially stable) development state

# Requirements
 - **Linux or Windows**

# Known bugs

 - "qt.qpa.xcb: QXcbConnection: XCB error: 3 (BadWindow), sequence: 1665, resource id: 37781937, major code: 40 (TranslateCoords), minor code: 0"
    - Sometimes this Qt error happens unpredictably, but it does not cause any disturbance and the user is not affected - this error happened to me when PyQt5 was installed using pacman, swithing to a pip install solves this problem
