# Alames - Digital signal analysing/logging software
Alames is an open-source digital signal analyser software intended for use with microcontroller driven analysers (wich could be built easily, even at home - the PCB gerbers will be available in the PCB subfolder)

It basically consists of two parts:
 - Measurement - logs the returned data from the Analyser and manages its settings
 - Data analysis - arranges and modifies the existing data in order to create charts, images or reports from it
