# Warning
This piece of SW is not intended to use after I shut down the development of my projects hardware side, whose files were not updated recently and also were not yet fully documented. 

Maybe in the future I will use this project as a reference and create something similar >> My work in progress is to create an usb analyzer to measure analog voltages and/or digital signals as well, with wide connector support and high sample rates at an affordable price.
