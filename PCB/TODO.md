Bring up **new ideas** how to improve:
 - Accuracy >> maybe attach an ADC with higher accuracy to SPI
 - Sampling rate [select type of ADC] >> flash ADC should be OK but its accuracy may be a problem, also consider speed of AVR > maybe a close approximation ADC would be better
 - overall design:
    - Rethink PCB size
    - Where would it be mounted: *custom 3d printed case*
    - maybe add a display for user interaction > indeed it's useless because the PC screen is mainly used for interaction
